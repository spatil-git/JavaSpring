# Demo using Spring Dependancy Injection

Spring framework helps to add the dependancy in the class using the @Component annotation.
Dependacies can be introduced using either the Costructor or the Setters. In case of multiple beans @primary can be used
to select the primary bean for autowiring (@Autowired).
